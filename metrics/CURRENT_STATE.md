## HOW I GOT HERE

I built everything here with agentic teams—one human orchestrating multiple LLMs across different platforms. That's my secret sauce.

**What agents built:**
- ProofPack (production fraud detection)
- QED v12 (autonomous telemetry)
- AXIOM (physics discovery)
- This entire standard repo
- Starter kit with 6 passing compliance tests
- Outreach materials (case study, ROI calculator, technical overview)

**What agents can't do:**
- Navigate government procurement
- Build FDA regulatory relationships
- Bring decades of domain credibility
- Open doors that require human trust

That's why I'm recruiting a working group.
