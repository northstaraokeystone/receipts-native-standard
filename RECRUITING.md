# Open Positions: Receipts-Native Working Group

We're building the receipts-native category from day zero with a working group model.

**Unlike other category creators** who built tech first and standardized later, we're doing it reverse:

**standard → working group → ecosystem**

This is possible because ProofPack already proves the tech works.

## WHY JOIN?

### Shape a New Category

Receipts-native is a standards vacuum. The term is used by 5+ builders (Hackett MetaOS, Brevis, Miden, idOS, Keystone) with zero canonical definition—until now.

You get to define what it means.

### First-Mover Advantage

- Co-author the standard that others will implement
- Your implementation becomes a reference
- Your organization becomes category-defining

### Real Problems, Real Impact

Target domains: government fraud ($1T+ addressable), autonomous systems, clinical trials, defense. These are high-consequence systems where accountability isn't optional.

## STEERING COMMITTEE (6 Open Seats)

### Seat 2: ZK/Cryptography Expert

**Profile:**
- Experience with zero-knowledge proofs or verifiable computation
- Can advise on cryptographic receipt design
- Understands proof systems and verification

**Potential orgs:** Starkware, zkSync, Aztec, Polygon, RISC Zero, Succinct, academic cryptography labs

**Why receipts-native needs you:** ZK proofs + receipts = verifiable computation with audit trail. The intersection is powerful.

---

### Seat 3: Enterprise Compliance Practitioner

**Profile:**
- SOC2, ISO 27001, HIPAA, or similar compliance background
- Can map receipts-native to existing frameworks
- Understands audit requirements and evidence standards

**Potential orgs:** Vanta, Drata, Secureframe, Big 4 tech advisory, compliance consultancies

**Why receipts-native needs you:** Compliance is about evidence. Receipts are evidence. The mapping is natural but needs domain expertise.

---

### Seat 4: Government/Defense Systems Architect

**Profile:**
- Experience with NIST, FedRAMP, or DoD systems
- Can navigate procurement and regulatory requirements
- Understands government buying cycles

**Potential orgs:** Defense contractors, government consulting firms, DIU alumni, federal CTOs

**Why receipts-native needs you:** Government is the largest buyer of accountability infrastructure. We need someone who speaks their language.

---

### Seat 5: Healthcare/FDA Regulatory Expert

**Profile:**
- Clinical trial or medical device background
- Understands FDA 21 CFR Part 11 (electronic records)
- Experience with regulatory submissions

**Potential orgs:** Pharma companies, device manufacturers, CROs, FDA alumni, healthcare IT

**Why receipts-native needs you:** 21 CFR Part 11 = receipts. The regulatory framework already demands what we're building.

---

### Seat 6: Autonomous Systems Engineer

**Profile:**
- Self-driving, robotics, or UAV experience
- Safety-critical system design
- Understands incident reconstruction needs

**Potential orgs:** Tesla, Waymo, Cruise, Aurora, drone companies, robotics startups, autonomous vehicle suppliers

**Why receipts-native needs you:** When autonomous systems fail, receipts enable reconstruction. This is existential for the industry.

---

### Seat 7: Open Source Infrastructure Maintainer

**Profile:**
- Maintained widely-used OSS project
- Experience with community governance
- Understands how standards get adopted

**Potential orgs:** CNCF maintainers, Linux Foundation contributors, Apache committers, successful OSS founders

**Why receipts-native needs you:** Standards succeed through community. We need someone who's built community before.

---

## REQUIREMENTS

### Must Have (ONE of these)

1. **Production implementation:** Receipts-native system deployed in production
2. **Significant contribution:** Major contribution to standard, tooling, or documentation
3. **Domain expertise:** Deep expertise in one of the target domains

### Nice to Have

- Industry network in your domain
- Prior standards body experience
- Technical writing skills
- Public speaking / conference presence

---

## TIME COMMITMENT

**Minimal but meaningful:**

- 1 monthly meeting (1 hour, virtual)
- Async participation in standard evolution (GitHub issues/PRs)
- Vote on proposals within 7 days
- (Optional) Represent working group at conferences

We respect your time. No busywork.

---

## WHAT YOU GET

1. **Co-authorship** of the receipts-native standard
2. **Steering vote** on category direction
3. **Network** with other high-consequence system builders
4. **Recognition** as founding working group member
5. **First access** to ecosystem opportunities

---

## APPLY

1. Open GitHub issue using ["Join Working Group" template](/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/join-working-group.md)

2. Include:
   - Your background and organization
   - Why receipts-native matters to your domain
   - What you would contribute
   - (Optional) Link to existing receipts-native implementation

3. Steering committee reviews within 30 days

4. Welcome call + first meeting invitation

---

## FIRST MEETING

**When:** February 2025 (exact date TBD based on member availability)

**Agenda:**
- Charter ratification
- Roadmap review
- Standard evolution priorities
- Working group norms

---

## QUESTIONS?

- Open a GitHub issue with the `question` label
- Check the [CHARTER.md](/working-group/CHARTER.md) for governance details
- Review the [DEFINITION.md](/DEFINITION.md) for what we're standardizing

---

## THE OPPORTUNITY

Most category creators (HashiCorp, Stripe, Docker) built tech first, then standards emerged organically.

We're doing it differently: **standard first, working group from day zero, ecosystem follows.**

ProofPack proves the tech works. Now we need the working group to prove the category is real.

**Join us.**
